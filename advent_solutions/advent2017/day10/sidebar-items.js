Once this process is complete, what is the result of multiplying the first two numbers in the list?"],["part2","Finally, the standard way to represent a Knot Hash is as a single [hexadecimal] string; the final output is the dense hash in hexadecimal notation. Because each number in your dense hash will be between `0` and `255` (inclusive), always represent each number as two hexadecimal digits (including a leading zero as necessary). So, if your first three numbers are `64, 7, 255`, they correspond to the hexadecimal numbers `40, 07, ff`, and so the first six characters of the hash would be `4007ff`. Because every Knot Hash is sixteen such numbers, the hexadecimal representation is always `32` hexadecimal digits (`0`-`f`) long."]]});
